Hey there, I'm ilona! or ilonachan if you like (pronouns: she/her). I'm a math student from Germany, and sometimes I code in my free time.

I'm interested in all kinds of things, because focusing isn't really my strong suit. Maybe I'll try making a game someday,
maybe I'll continue working on my discord bots, maybe I'll actually manage to contribute worthwhile code to the FOSS community...
maybe someday I'll actually finish something I've started. In the meantime feel free to use whichever of my half-baked results look useful.

The programming languages I can work with reasonably well are:
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript
- Rust (still learning)

I'm on Mastodon: [@ilonachan@mas.to](https://mas.to/@ilonachan) (I just picked the instance because the domain would be easy lol)  
If Twitter still exists, I'm [@ilonachan16](https://twitter.com/ilonachan16).  
with email you can reach me at ilonachan16@gmail.com.
